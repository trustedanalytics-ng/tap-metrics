# Ceph Exporter  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/digitalocean/ceph_exporter?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/digitalocean/ceph_exporter) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/digitalocean/ceph_exporter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/digitalocean/ceph_exporter) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/digitalocean/ceph_exporter/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/digitalocean/ceph_exporter?branch=master) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/digitalocean/ceph_exporter)](https://goreportcard.com/report/digitalocean/ceph_exporter)
Prometheus exporter that scrapes meta information about a running ceph cluster. All the information gathered from the cluster is done by interacting with the monitors using an appropriate wrapper over `rados_mon_command()`. Hence, no additional setup is necessary other than having a working ceph cluster.

## Dependencies

You should ideally run this exporter from the client that can talk to
Ceph. Like any other ceph client it needs the following files to run
correctly.

 * `ceph.conf` containing your ceph configuration.
 * `ceph.<user>.keyring` in order to authenticate to your cluster.

Ceph exporter will automatically pick those up if they are present in
any of the [default
locations](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/configuration/ceph-conf/#the-configuration-file). Otherwise you will need to provide the configuration manually using `--ceph.config` flag.

We use Ceph's [official Golang client](https://github.com/ceph/go-ceph) to run commands on the cluster.

Ceph exporter is tested only on Ceph's Hammer(v0.94) and Jewel(v10.2) releases. It might not work as expected with older or non-LTS versions of Ceph.

## Flags

Name | Description | Default
---- | ---- | ----
telemetry.addr | Host:Port pair to run exporter on | `*:9128`
telemetry.path | URL Path for surfacing metrics to prometheus | `/metrics`
ceph.config | Path to ceph configuration file | ""

## Installation

Typical way of installing in Go should work.

```
go install
```

A Makefile is provided in case you find a need for it.

## Docker Image

It is possible to run the exporter as a docker image. The port `9128` is
exposed for running the default ceph exporter.

The exporter needs your ceph configuration in order to establish communication with the monitors. You can either pass it in as an additional command or ideally you would just mount the directory containing both your `ceph.conf` and your user's keyring under the default `/etc/ceph` location that `Ceph` checks for.

A sample run would look like:

```bash
$ docker build -t digitalocean/ceph_exporter .
...
<build takes place here>
...
$ docker run -v /etc/ceph:/etc/ceph -p=9128:9128 -it digitalocean/ceph_exporter
```

You would need to ensure your image can talk over to the monitors so if
it needs access to your host's network stack you might need to add
`--net=host` to the above command. It makes the port mapping redundant
so the `-p` flag can be removed.

Point your prometheus to scrape from `:9128` on your host now (or your port
of choice if you decide to change it).
